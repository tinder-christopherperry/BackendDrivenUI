# BackendDrivenUI

An example of how some screens could be driven by the backend at Tinder.

The example uses Android Architecture components and MVVM. See the [ViewModel](https://github.com/tinder-christopherperry/BackendDrivenUI/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/tinder/backendui/ui/main/MainViewModel.kt) for an example of a response (hardcoded) from the server.
